Push_swap - Sorting Algorithm Project
This repository contains my implementation of the push_swap project from 1337, a challenge focused on efficiently sorting a stack of numbers in ascending order using a limited set of operations.

About the Project
Push_swap is a sorting algorithm project that requires optimising the number of operations to sort a stack. I implemented the chunk algorithm, a simple yet efficient approach for sorting while ensuring minimal operations.

Through this project, I also worked extensively with linked listsâ€”an area I initially struggled with but significantly improved in throughout the process.

Key Features
- Chunk Algorithm: A balanced strategy that optimises sorting efficiency.
- Linked List Implementation: Enhanced my understanding and handling of linked lists.
- Optimised Sorting: Focused on reducing the number of operations.

Learning Outcomes
- Improved my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Gained deeper insights into data structures, especially linked lists.
- Developed a more structured and efficient coding approach.
I hope this repository helps others understand and implement the push_swap project more effectively!
